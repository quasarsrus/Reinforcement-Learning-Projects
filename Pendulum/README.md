DQN implementation on simple pendulum control problem. Compared the performances with my NN package, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. 
(Neural Networks might just be chaotic systems! Maybe a research avenue connecting them to differential geometry and 
vector fields. The gradients can be thought of as being on a tangent bundle which is also a smooth manifold.)

Uncomment and comment out specific lines in the 'learn' function if not using ankh.py.
